Publishing is the art of transforming work into a form that can be consumed.


===


If you are writing, making videos, or painting, at some point your work needs to be captured, refined and transformed into a medium so that it can be shared 

# Sharing

Sharing - whether traditionally printed or digitally copied - requires work that is ready to be moved into a technical process for reproduction

A single content set can serve multiple publishing types.

When content is well formed from the start, it makes the publishing process more streamlined.

# Consumption

Without consumption, there is no point to publish. 

this means there is an audience for the work 

There are two types of consumers: people and robots

## People

- accessibile

- sitemaps
- semantics

# Templates
