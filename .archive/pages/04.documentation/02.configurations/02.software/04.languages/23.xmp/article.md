> An XMP file is a metadata file used by Adobe programs such as Photoshop and Bridge. It contains the edits made to a camera raw file, such as a .CR2 or .NEF file, and is automatically generated and saved in the same directory as the corresponding camera raw file. XMP files include various properties of an image file, such as a description, title, keywords, author, copyright, brightness, exposure, contrast, crop angle, shadow, saturation, sharpness, tint, and temperature.
